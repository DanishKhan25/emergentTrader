# ü§ñ Training 2000 Stocks Analysis - `/ai-signals/train/batch`

## üéØ **What Happens When Training 2000 Stocks**

When you call `/ai-signals/train/batch` with 2000 stocks, here's the complete breakdown:

## ‚ö° **Immediate Response (< 1 second)**

```json
POST /ai-signals/train/batch
{
  "symbols": null,  // null = entire universe (2000+ stocks)
  "shariah_only": true,
  "max_concurrent": 5
}
```

**Immediate API Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Batch training started for 2000 symbols",
    "symbols_count": 2000,
    "max_concurrent": 5,
    "estimated_time": "800 minutes",  // 2000 * 2 / 5 = 800 minutes
    "status": "training_started"
  }
}
```

## üîÑ **Background Processing Flow**

### **1. Batch Processing Strategy**
- **Concurrent Batches**: Processes 5 stocks simultaneously (configurable)
- **Sequential Batches**: 2000 √∑ 5 = 400 batches
- **Batch Delay**: 1 second between batches
- **Total Batches Time**: 400 batches √ó 1 second = 400 seconds (6.7 minutes)

### **2. Per-Stock Training Process**
For each of the 2000 stocks:

```python
# 1. Data Fetching (30-60 seconds per stock)
- Fetch 2 years of historical data via yfinance
- Download OHLCV data for technical analysis
- Handle API rate limits and retries

# 2. Feature Engineering (10-20 seconds per stock)  
- Calculate 45+ technical indicators
- Create lag features (1, 2, 3, 5, 10 days)
- Generate moving averages (5, 10, 20, 50, 200 periods)
- Compute momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic)
- Calculate volatility measures (ATR, rolling volatility)

# 3. Model Training (60-120 seconds per stock)
- Train 3 algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression
- Train for 3 horizons: 1D, 7D, 30D predictions
- Total: 9 models per stock
- Cross-validation and performance evaluation
- Model persistence with joblib

# 4. Validation & Storage (5-10 seconds per stock)
- Validate model accuracy (minimum 70% threshold)
- Save models to disk
- Update training statistics
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Estimates**

  "symbols": null,  // Load top 100 from universe
  "max_concurrent": 5
}
```
- **Time**: 3-5 hours
- **Purpose**: Test scalability
- **Risk**: Medium

### **Phase 3: Full Universe (2000 stocks)**
```json
{
  "symbols": null,  // Entire universe
  "max_concurrent": 5
}
```
- **Time**: 10-15 hours
- **Purpose**: Production deployment
- **Risk**: High

## üîß **Optimization Strategies**

}
```

### **2. Staged Training**
```python
# Train in chunks of 500 stocks
for chunk in [0, 500, 1000, 1500]:
    train_batch(symbols[chunk:chunk+500])
```

### **3. Priority Training**
```python
# Train high-volume stocks first
priority_stocks = ["RELIANCE", "TCS", "INFY", ...]
train_batch(priority_stocks)
```

## üìä **Monitoring Commands**

### **Real-time Progress:**
```bash
# Monitor training logs
tail -f python_backend/logs/emergent_trader.log | grep "training"

# Monitor system resources
htop

# Check model files being created
watch -n 5 'ls -la python_backend/models/price_prediction/ | wc -l'
