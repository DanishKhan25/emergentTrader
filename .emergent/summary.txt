<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of the EmergentTrader platform. The primary focus was on establishing the foundational backend components and an initial Next.js frontend to demonstrate core functionality. Key initial steps included clarifying database choice (switching from PostgreSQL to MongoDB as per user's preference), installing necessary Python dependencies, and structuring the Python backend. The engineer then implemented core modules like , , , and . FastAPI integration was set up via  and linked to Next.js API routes. An initial Next.js dashboard () was created, designed to display signals. The current state reflects a working backend API that can fetch stock data and has commenced testing for signal generation, signifying the aha moment objective is nearing completion.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a production-grade, Python-only, real-money-ready trading signal system named **EmergentTrader**.
**Core Objectives:**
1.  **Modular Strategy Engine:** Support pluggable strategies (Swing, Momentum, Multibagger, Breakout, Mean Reversion, Value Investing, Fundamental Growth, Sector Rotation, Low Volatility, Pivot CPR).
2.  **Shariah Compliance Filter:** Dynamic NSE universe via , filtered by JSON criteria.
3.  **Backtest & Forward Test:** Historical (2012-2018) and walk-forward (2019-2024).
4.  **ML-Based Signal Filter:** Classifier trained on backtest outcomes to score/reject signals.
5.  **Market Regime Switch:** Detect bull/bear/choppy states (e.g., 50 vs 200 SMA on NIFTY).
6.  **Risk Management:** Volatility-based position sizing (1% capital/ATR), sector exposure limits, correlation checks.
7.  **Real-Time Monitoring & Notifications:** Monitor open signals 3x/day, Telegram alerts (Entry, Target, SL), concise messages to Next.js dashboard.
8.  **Dashboard & API:** Next.js frontend (Signals, Performance, Stock Details pages), FastAPI backend with Swagger docs, and specific API endpoints (, , , , , , , , , ).
9.  **Data Enrichment:** Fundamental metrics (PE, EPS growth, ROE), Volatility (beta, ATR), rolling yearly data segments via .
**Clarifications:**  for data (no API key needed), no immediate authentication (will be added), Oracle Cloud deployment later, Telegram and Email notifications (credentials in ), MongoDB was chosen over PostgreSQL after a clarification, no specific logging/monitoring frameworks requested, UI test user ID/password needed later, testing framework preference was not specified initially.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Python Ecosystem:**  for financial data,  for data manipulation,  for numerical operations,  for ML, usage: websockets [--version | <uri>].
-   **Backend Framework:** FastAPI for API routes, serving Python logic.
-   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with React for the dashboard.
-   **UI Library:** shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for styling and components.
-   **Database:** MongoDB for data storage (chosen over PostgreSQL).
-   **Core Modules:** Modular Strategy Engine, Shariah Compliance Filter, Backtest Engine.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a structured architecture as initially described, with a clear separation between frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI + Python core modules).



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   **/app/.env:** This file was updated to include placeholders for , , , , , and . It's crucial for configuring third-party integrations and database connections.
-   **/app/python_backend/services/yfinance_fetcher.py:** This new file is responsible for fetching historical and real-time stock data from . It's a core data source for the trading platform.
-   **/app/python_backend/core/shariah_compliance.py:** This new module contains logic to filter the stock universe based on Shariah compliance criteria, a key product requirement.
-   **/app/python_backend/core/strategies/momentum_strategy.py:** Implements the first trading strategy, Momentum Trading, allowing the system to generate signals based on specific momentum criteria.
-   **/app/python_backend/core/backtest_engine.py:** This module is created to handle historical backtesting of trading strategies, processing historical data to evaluate strategy performance.
-   **/app/python_backend/core/signal_engine.py:** This central module is responsible for orchestrating the signal generation process, integrating data fetching, strategy application, and potentially future ML filtering.
-   **/app/python_backend/main.py:** This serves as the FastAPI application entry point, defining the backend API routes and integrating the Python core modules. It's the bridge between the Next.js frontend and the trading logic.
-   **/app/app/api/[[...path]]/route.js:** This Next.js API route file was significantly updated. It acts as a proxy, forwarding requests to the Python FastAPI backend, allowing the Next.js frontend to communicate with the Python trading engine. It includes routes for  and .
-   **/app/app/page.js:** This is the main dashboard component for the Next.js frontend. It was updated to fetch and display stock data and potentially signals, providing the initial UI for the EmergentTrader platform.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement other modular strategies (Swing, Multibagger, Breakout, Mean Reversion, Value Investing, Fundamental Growth, Sector Rotation, Low Volatility, Pivot CPR).
-   Develop the ML-based signal filter and training pipeline.
-   Implement market regime detection.
-   Develop the risk management module (position sizing, exposure limits).
-   Integrate Telegram bot for notifications and commands.
-   Implement email notifications.
-   Set up the automated scheduler for monitoring.
-   Complete the Next.js dashboard with full performance charts and stock detail views.
-   Write automated tests (unit + integration).
-   Develop the Dockerfile for containerized deployment.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has successfully set up the foundational components of the EmergentTrader platform. This includes:
1.  **Backend Structure:** A  directory was created, housing core trading logic modules (, , , , ) and a FastAPI entry point ().
2.  **Dependency Installation:** Required Python packages (, , , , usage: websockets [--version | <uri>]) were installed.
3.  **Environment Configuration:** The  file was updated with placeholders for future credentials (Telegram, Email) and existing database (MongoDB) and base URL.
4.  **Frontend-Backend Integration:** The Next.js API route () was updated to act as a proxy, forwarding requests to the Python FastAPI backend.
5.  **Initial Dashboard:** The  was updated to serve as the main dashboard, configured to fetch and display data from the backend.
6.  **Initial Backend Testing:** The  API endpoint was successfully tested, confirming that data fetching from  through the Python backend and Next.js proxy is functional. It returned 53 stocks.
Currently, the engineer is poised to test the signal generation functionality, which leverages the  and  modules created earlier.
