- GET /api/health/batch-system - Comprehensive system health
```

## 📊 Batch Configuration Options

### Conservative Configuration (High Protection)
```python
BatchConfig(
    batch_size=25,
    delay_between_items=3.0,      # 3 seconds
    delay_between_batches=45.0,   # 45 seconds
    rate_limit_delay=120.0        # 2 minutes when rate limited
)
```

### Balanced Configuration (Recommended)
```python
BatchConfig(
    batch_size=50,                # Default
    delay_between_items=2.0,      # 2 seconds
    delay_between_batches=30.0,   # 30 seconds
    rate_limit_delay=60.0         # 1 minute when rate limited
)
```

### Aggressive Configuration (Higher Throughput)
```python
BatchConfig(
    batch_size=100,
    delay_between_items=1.0,      # 1 second
    delay_between_batches=20.0,   # 20 seconds
    rate_limit_delay=60.0         # 1 minute when rate limited
)
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Batched Processing
```python
from core.enhanced_shariah_filter_batched import BatchedShariahFilter
from services.yfinance_fetcher import YFinanceFetcher

# Initialize components
fetcher = YFinanceFetcher()
batched_filter = BatchedShariahFilter(batch_size=50)

# Process stocks in batches
results = batched_filter.get_shariah_universe_batched(
    stock_universe, fetcher, force_refresh=False
)

# Access results
compliant_stocks = results['compliant_stocks']
batch_stats = results['batch_stats']
print(f"Success rate: {results['summary']['success_rate']:.1f}%")
```

### 2. API Usage
```bash
# Get batched Shariah compliance
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/stocks/shariah/batched?batch_size=50&limit=200"

# Check batch processing status
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/stocks/shariah/batch-status"

# Get system health
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/health/batch-system"
```

### 3. Custom Configuration
```python
# Create filter with custom batch size
batched_filter = BatchedShariahFilter(batch_size=25)

# Update configuration
batched_filter.batch_config.delay_between_batches = 45.0
batched_filter.batch_config.rate_limit_delay = 120.0

# Process with custom settings
results = batched_filter.get_shariah_universe_batched(stocks, fetcher)
```
