## 🚀 **HOW TO USE**

### **1. Basic ML-Enhanced Signal Generation**
```python
from core.ml_enhanced_signal_engine import MLEnhancedSignalEngine

# Initialize with ML enabled
engine = MLEnhancedSignalEngine(enable_ml=True)

# Generate high-quality ML-enhanced signals
signals = engine.generate_ml_enhanced_signals(
    shariah_only=True,
    max_symbols=50,
    min_ml_probability=0.65  # High quality threshold
)

# Each signal now includes:
# - ml_probability: ML-predicted success probability
# - ml_recommendation: STRONG_BUY/BUY/WEAK_BUY/SKIP
# - ml_quality_score: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/POOR
# - confidence_adjustment: How ML changed original confidence
```

### **2. API Usage**
```bash
# Start the ML-enhanced API server
python python_backend/ml_enhanced_api_handler.py

# Generate ML-enhanced signals
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/signals/ml-enhanced" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "shariah_only": true,
    "max_symbols": 30,
    "min_ml_probability": 0.7
  }'

# Get market context
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/market/context"

# Check ML performance
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/ml/performance"
```

### **3. Available Strategies**
- **`ml_consensus`** - ⭐ **RECOMMENDED** - ML-enhanced consensus signals
- **`consensus`** - Multi-strategy consensus without ML
- **Individual strategies** - All 10 strategies with optional ML enhancement
